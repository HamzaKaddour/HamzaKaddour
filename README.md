## Projects
- WebSecScore: a comprehensive web application security testing tool designed to assess the security level of web domains. Subsequently, I will be implementing security tests and using some available APIs to calculate a security score for the input domain(s), and fetching the results in a web page. The project will focus on two distinct types of domains: personal domains and corporate domains. The tool will offer a suite of security tests, ensuring that personal web applications are rigorously tested for common vulnerabilities, while corporate domains will undergo additional enterprise-level tests that include compliance checks.
- SOC Automation Project
